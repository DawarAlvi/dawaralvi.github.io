To create a new post copy this file and start writing. Set the title, tags and date. And when you are ready to publish set the draft to false (or delete it entirely).

You can add links like this:
{% a 'This is the link text', 'https://google.com' %}

And embedding a YouTube is as simple as:
{% yt 'dQw4w9WgXcQ' %}
