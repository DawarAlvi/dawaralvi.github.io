I've been meaning to have my own blog for quite a while now. To have a place where I can compose my thoughts and ocassionally come back to them after some time for refinement or review. But in the age of LLM chat bots spitting out paragraphs upon paragraphs of text that the average person might even find decent, writing without AI aid not only seems to be falling out of favour but you risk exposing yourself to ridicule if you dare to engage in such folly.
I don't mean to come off as a luddite, but having used these tools and having seen their capabilities as well as shortcomings, it's not difficult to come to the same conclusions as mine. Do I see the potential? Absolutely, but even if ChatGPT could create flawless prose with complex and novel ideas paired with excellent excution, and copious amounts of metaphors and other literary devices that brought the subject matter to life, I still would not use it. And that brings me to the second reason of why I decided to create this blog. I want to become better at writing. And in writing like any other art form, the key to mastery is repetition. And using an LLM to do the heavy lifting will only hinder rather than help me in achieving this goal.

Wow that was not the opener I had in mind when I first sat down to write this piece. But the elephant in the room (or the 'mammoth in the den' as my one of my friends would say) that is AI needed to be addressed. Keeping in line with the two original goals of this blog that is to have a place to collect my thoughts and become better at writing, I've also decided to forego the help of any word processing program that provides the quality of life functionalities such as spell and grammar check. How far I'm able to go without such nice to haves remains to be seen. This is also the reason why you might see a more that usual amount of typos in my text. This is a compromise I'm willing to make.

After I had decided to create a blog, what the content of said blog will be was (and still is) yet to be seen. Although I do have a vague idea that since I'll mostly be writing about the things that interest me, it'll be about software development, computer graphics, writing (both fiction and non-fiction), art (mostly the art that I create, no deciphering Picasso's Guernica, sry :P), gaming and books.

As this is my first post, (hopefully first of many) I expect it to be quite rough. Maybe I'll even wince at this writing in a year's time (this has happened before). But a thousand miles' journey begins with a single step. And the first step is often the hardest one to make. Although my writings will be for my own sake I've decided to make them public. So feel free to browse this blog and tell me what you think. Have a wonderful day.
