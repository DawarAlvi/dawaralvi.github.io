<b>Update Jan 2026:</b> The original post was first written back in 2025. I've used this exact setup for almost a year, even finishing the game's campaign with it. But recently I've moved on to . The developer has done a fantastic job at optimizing the mod pack lately. And the entire reason I had to apply my own list of mods is mainly due to the fact that I was not able to run GAMMA on my crusty old laptop.

Here's a list of mods that I like to use over my installation of {% a 'Anomaly 1.7.2', 'https://anomalymod.com' %} . I use {% a 'Mod Organizer 2', 'https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer' %} of course to manage these mods.

They are added in MO2 in the same order I've listed them here.

{% a 'MCM (Mod Configuration Menu)', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-mod-configuration-menu' %}
Shaders PBR, Color Grading, Corrected Cubemaps, Fixed
Bloom, shader_param controls all come from the from the same mod: {% a 'Enhanced Shaders and Color Grading', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/enhanced-shaders-and-color-grading-for-151" %}

{% a 'BAS (Boomsticks and Sharpsticks)', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/boomsticks-and-sharpsticks" %} and {% a 'GTR (Global Texture Rework)', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/global-texture-rework-beta" %} are quite resource intensive and I often leave them off.

{% a 'Grok\'s Better Sounds', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/10-groks-better-sound-for-anomaly-151" %}

{% a 'JSRS (Better Weapon Sounds)', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/solarint-gunshot-overhaul" %}

The game is so annoying without {% a 'Soundscape Overhaul', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/soundscape-overhaul-2" %} and {% a 'Remove Dropping Weapons From Damage', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/remove-dropping-weapons-from-damage-for-152" %}

{% a 'Trader Overhaul', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/trader-overhaul-complete" %}: An extensive overhaul of all of the traders in the zone made to create more immersion as well as a better reason to actually travel the zone from place to place.

{% a 'Realistic Loot Drops', "https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/realistic-loot-drop-15" %}: Makes the loot condition based on the stalkers rank, no more 1% gear on a Legendary stalker.

{% a 'Stealth', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/stealth1' %}: Changes the formula for NPC's detection. Based on light and distance, weight, body state, memory and many other factors. Flashlights/headlamps/campfires give, visibility boost to enemies via modified luminosity.

{% a 'Crooks Faction ID', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/crooks-faction-identification-ui' %}: Replaces the vanilla "under the central dot" stalker identification UI. When aiming around an NPC, it will display its faction patch, name and rank in the bottom left corner. Even works with central dot disabled!

{% a 'Instant Tooltip', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/instant-tooltip-for-rc18-23' %}, {% a 'Sorting Plus', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/sorting-plus' %}, and {% a 'Maids Vanilla HD Icons', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/maids-vanilla-hd-icons' %} make interacting with the inventory much more pleasant.

{% a 'Nitpickers Modpack', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/nitpickermodpack' %}

{% a 'Nicer Flashlights', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/nicer-flashlights-and-headlamps-addon' %}

{% a 'EFT Reposition', 'https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/alternate-aim-sights-for-eft-reposition' %}
