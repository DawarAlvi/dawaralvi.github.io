It is quite often when I sit down to write, even before I type a single character, doubt creeps into my mind. If what I write is not perfect in every way is it even worth writing? I sounds absurd when I say it like that. But this is the best I can describe the feeling, whenever I decide not just to write, but to undertake any creative pursuit that I know will be viewed by someone other than me.
